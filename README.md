Description
==============
Catch the dwarves as they leap from the cliff! As the dwarves fall they must be caught by the eagle. Every time a dwarf is caught, the score increases by 1. If all 13 dwarves are caught, then the game is won. If one is not caught by the catcher then it is game over. If you are hit by five pincones, then it is game over. After winning or losing, press any key to go back to the start screen.
*glitch: the game does not restart if you lost. It will bring you back to the start screen, but it picks up from where you left off when you lost.
